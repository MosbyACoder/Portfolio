            <p>Project 1: educational application for learning langauges.</p>
            <p>closest app I have found is Mondly by Pearson. App can be used in virtual reality with meta quest vr headsets.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Project 2: connecting multiple computers</p>
            <p>synergy app is closest I've found to the idea. uses one mouse and one keyboard between several computers. Can't share computing resources but can copy and paste between systems.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Project 3: use Ipad as drawing tablet</p>
            <p>project blue is closest I've found to the idea. Essentially uses Ipad as a spare monitor.</p>
